  <h1 class="Title">Ocean Pollution</h1>
  <p class="para">Ocean pollution is the presence of harmful substances in the ocean, which can negativly effect marine life, ecosystems, and even human health. Common types of ocean pollution are:</p>
  <div class="row1">
    <p class="PP">Plastic Pollution <img class="Plastic" alt="Image" src="https://www.reusethisbag.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ocean-pollution-plastics.jpg.webp"></p>
    <p class="PP">Chemical Pollution <img class="Chemical" alt="Image" src="https://backtoblueinitiative.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/sourcesimage.jpeg"></p>
  </div>
  <div class="row2">

    <p class="PP">Oil Pollution <img class="Oil" src="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/education/tutorial-coastal/oil-spills/os-03-skimming-oil.jpg"></p>

  </div>
  <p class="para">Alot of these types of pollution are interconnected, and their cumulative impacts can result in detrimental consequences for the stabiltiy of ocean econsytems.</p>

  <ul>
    <li class= "pla">Plastic Pollution</li>
      <p class="para">One of the most significant forms of ocean pollution, plastic waste, including bottles, bags, and microplastics, poses a severe threat to marine animals, which can ingest or become entangled in it.</p> <img class="image" alt="Image" src="https://d29fhpw069ctt2.cloudfront.net/clipart/89071/preview/cbrn_preview_f4a2.png"> 
    <li class= "pla">Chemical Pollution  </li>
      <p class="para">Chemicals from agricultural runoff, industrial discharges, oil spills, and untreated sewage can contaminate the ocean, affecting marine life and disrupting ecosystems.</p> <img class="images" alt="Image" src="https://cdni.iconscout.com/illustration/premium/thumb/oil-spill-into-ocean-10771024-8703429.png?f=webp">
    <li class= "pla">Oil Pollution</li>
      <p class="para">Oil spills from shipping accidents, offshore drilling, and oil tankers release vast amounts of crude oil into the ocean, causing immediate harm to marine life and long-term damage to ecosystems.</p>
<h2 class="pla">Overall Effects</h2>
  <p class="para">The envoronmental impacts can be severe and long-lasting. Animals often assume the plasitic is food and ingest it. They can also get caught on the plasitic soda holders. Oil coats the feathers of birds and fur of mammals, making it difficult for them to regulate their body temperature causing them to ingest these toxic substances. </p>
  </ul>

<h2 class="head">Benefits of Awareness</h2>
  <ul>
    <li class="ListH">Environmental Conservation</li>
      <p class="para">Increased awareness helps people understand the importance of preserving the oceans and the diverse ecosystems they support. With greater awareness, individuals and communities are more likely to take action to reduce pollution and protect marine life.</p> <img class="Earth" alt="Image" src="https://www.alsc.ala.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Earth-animated-globe-clipart-free-images.png">
    <li class="ListH">Human Health</li>
      <p class="para">Ocean pollution can have direct and indirect impacts on human health, such as through contaminated seafood or exposure to harmful chemicals. Awareness helps people make informed choices about their consumption and lifestyle to minimize health risks.</p> <img class="Human" alt="Image" src="https://png.pngtree.com/png-clipart/20220117/original/pngtree-schematic-diagram-of-human-structure-virus-medical-health-png-image_7123825.png">
    <li class="ListH">Innovation and Solutions</li>
      <p class="para">Increased awareness stimulates innovation and encourages the development of sustainable solutions to address ocean pollution. From alternative materials to waste management technologies, awareness drives investment and research into new approaches to mitigate pollution and promote ocean health.</p> <img class="Solu" alt="Image" src="https://d29fhpw069ctt2.cloudfront.net/clipart/100873/preview/cyberscooty-computer-solutions_preview_e4c4.png">
